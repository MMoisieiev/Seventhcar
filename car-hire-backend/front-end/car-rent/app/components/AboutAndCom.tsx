We ran about 200 kms without any problem. Returning the car was as easy as the arrival, with Lakee waiting for us at 6AM in front of the terminal again. I highly recommend if you want an easy and great car rental!! :)',

He reaches you in advance via WhatsApp. The car pick up and return was very fast. Car was in excellent condition. We were lucky to get an upgrade during your rental. Certainly I recommend Doffay Car Rental for Seychelles, from the beginning to the end very smooth process.',
